Cloud Projects
===

This is a repository of projects that I did for the *Cloud Computing and Big Data* class at Columbia. Although the **Big Data** aspect of the course was lacking, the class taught me quite a lot about AWS. Apart from the projects, there were paper summaries, which too have been shared on [Github](https://github.com/prakhar1989/Paper-Summaries). Lastly, as a final course project I ended up building [bekanjoos](https://github.com/prakhar1989/bekanjoos).

### Technologies Used
Fortunately, the professor gave full freedom to use your tech stack of choice which give me a good avenue to try out some technologies in real-world projects.
